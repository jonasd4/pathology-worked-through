## Worked-Through Example: Cancer classification from images

This is the code for the first worked-through example: Cancer classification from images in our paper Explainable AI for Precision Pathology. 
We will train a model to classify different colorectal patches into tissue classes. 
The tissue classes are: Adipose (ADI), background (BACK), debris (DEB), lymphocytes (LYM), mucus (MUC), smooth muscle (MUS), normal colon mucosa (NORM), cancer-associated stroma (STR), colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelium (TUM).


The best way to get started is to clone this repository and follow the notebook.
