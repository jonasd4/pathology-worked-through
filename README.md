# Worked Through Example (Image Analysis)

* [List of Datasets](https://github.com/maduc7/Histopathology-Datasets#search)
* [Datset with different tissue types and cancer types](https://zenodo.org/record/5889558#.Y763o-zMLmF)
  * includes TCGA barcode which encodes from which Tissue source site (TSS) samples originate
  * possible classification problem: Kidney_Chromophobe, Kidney_renal_clear_cell_carcinoma, Kidney_renal_papillary_cell_carcinoma
  * does this classification problem make clinical sense?
