## Worked-Through Example: Cancer classification from images

This is the code for the first worked-through example: Cancer classification from images in our paper Explainable AI for Precision Pathology. 
We will train a model to classify different colorectal patches into tissue classes. 
The tissue classes are: Adipose (ADI), background (BACK), debris (DEB), lymphocytes (LYM), mucus (MUC), smooth muscle (MUS), normal colon mucosa (NORM), cancer-associated stroma (STR), colorectal adenocarcinoma epithelium (TUM).

The best way to get started is to clone this repository and follow the notebook.
You can also directly follow the notebook on Google Colab.
